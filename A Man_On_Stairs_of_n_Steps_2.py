Challenge # coding problem #
There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.

For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:

1, 1, 1, 12, 1, 11, 2, 11, 1, 22, 2

What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could climb any number from a set of positive integers X? For example, if X = {1, 3, 5}, you could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time.'''

A man can jump 1 or 2 steps at a time , find number of ways in which the man can climb  n  number of steps  ?

/*
example :::   input :: 3
                      output :: 3    // because 3 ways 
 1st way) 3 times 1 step (1,1,1)
 2nd way)1 time 2 steps together & then 1 step more(2,1)
 3rd way) 1 step & then 1 time 2 steps together(1,2)
 Remember man can take 1 or 2 steps at a time

//level :: easy & interesting 
//simple approach is welcome , with some explanation
