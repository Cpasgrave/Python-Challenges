'''
ðŸ”¡Letters & Boxes [Challenge]
The idea of this is like musical chairs ðŸ˜‚

You start off with say 5 letters and 5 boxes.

Each shuffle a box is removed forcing one letter to be nocked out of the game this repeats untill theres only one letter and 1 box left

Catch: Numbers are to be randomly shuffled around each time as follows

[a][b][c][d] < all letters have a box 

Shuffle 1,  --box

[c][d][b]    < "a" missed out and removed

Shuffle 2,  --box

[b][c]  <  "d" missed out

Shuffle 3, --box

[c]  < "b" missed out 

[c] < Won

Have fun â˜º
